# [NeoBuyer+ / Neopets Shop & Attic Autobuyer, Highlighter, & Automator](https://github.com/Unovamata/Neopets-Shop-And-Attic-Autobuyer-Cracked "Neopets Shop & Attic Highlighter & Autobuyer")

Welcome to the NeoBuyer+ user manual. With this guide, you will thoroughly understand how to configure, set up, and specify the settings that adjust to your AutoBuying style.

Importantly, as a developer, I am not responsible for any adverse impacts this extension holds on your account's compliance with TNT's rules. While the extension is silent and mindful of its botting activities, on your first install, you accept a warning regarding the awareness and effects Neopets automation can have on your account. That is the main reason why you are reading this manual in the first place.

NeoBuyer+ compromises to protect your account's integrity from recent policy or site changes TNT may push on Neopets. The extension receives constant updates while informing users of the contents of said updates. So, you can rest easy knowing that NeoBuyer+ will not steal your information or credentials while navigating the web.

NeoBuyer+ only works in English. There are no plans to support other languages, considering how broken several interfaces on Neopets are. To ensure optimal performance, set your Neopets language preference to English.

Please consider starring the project on its official GitHub page. Your support would greatly benefit the project's continued development. NeoBuyer+ has been a product of hundreds of hours of work, and your star would be a small token of appreciation.
