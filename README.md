# [Neopets Shop & Attic Highlighter & Autobuyer Crack](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neopets-shop-attic-highli/gcoedojijoejlngkneocccmnjkbbbfmd "Neopets Shop & Attic Highlighter & Autobuyer")
> Code optimized and adapted by: [Unovamata](https://github.com/Unovamata "Unovamata"). Original developer: autobuyerneopets.

I have been using this Auto-Buyer tool since its release. It supports lists and specific shops to snipe. I removed the pay-wall needed, making it available to all. I will continue to optimize the speed and buy-times offered by the extension.

## How to install
- Download the extension files and save them to a location on your computer.
- Open Google Chrome.
- Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the screen to open the Chrome menu.
- Select "More tools" from the drop-down menu, then click on "Extensions."
- Make sure the "Developer mode" option is turned on by toggling the switch in the upper-right corner of the screen.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
- In the file explorer window that appears, navigate to the location where you saved the extension files and select the folder containing them.
- Click the "Select Folder" button to install the extension.
- The extension will now appear in your list of installed extensions in Google Chrome.
- Navigate to the option page the Neobuyer has and configure the parameters you want to use.

> **Use the tool at your own risk, do not be greedy.** Research legitimate times and adjust settings based on your ping. Lower the Autobuyer's times if you lose out on too many items, but use the tool responsibly.

## Tips

- I have not yet received any warnings or experienced account freezing while using this AutoBuyer extension. However, I would suggest some tips and guidelines to help prevent potential issues with Neopets.
- Firstly, it's essential not to be too greedy while restocking. It's recommended not to go on ABing for more than 8 hours at a stretch as it may draw Neopets' attention towards your account. So, let's use common sense and not overdo it.
- In case you fail to buy an expensive item, don't worry. It's better to keep a low profile and aim for normal items that can yield a profit of at least 5-10K NP. You can also choose shops with high profitability or low competition.
- Before activating the ABer, make sure to check all your options carefully. Most of the options are set in milliseconds, so it's best to be cautious while setting them up.
- To search for items that you want to buy from specific shops and create your own custom item sniping list, you can use JellyNeo's item database and play around with the filters their database offers.

## New Features

- Cracked the multiple paywalls the extension had.
- Cleaner interfaces with better navigation.
- [Neon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neon/hpbfhmapaaocfnpmbikclmeokcgpljnm "Neon") extension integration for quicker SW searches.
- User's shop auto-pricer.
- Shop restock timer.
- Daily update checker.
- Better Quickstock.

## End Notes

In the future I plan to add better interfaces and optimizing the code in general to make it faster while ABing, as always thanks to the [original developer.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neopets-shop-attic-highli/gcoedojijoejlngkneocccmnjkbbbfmd "original developer.")
