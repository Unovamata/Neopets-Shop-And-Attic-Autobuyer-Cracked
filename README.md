# [NeoBuyer+ / Neopets Shop & Attic Highlighter & Autobuyer Crack](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neopets-shop-attic-highli/gcoedojijoejlngkneocccmnjkbbbfmd "Neopets Shop & Attic Highlighter & Autobuyer")
> Code optimized and improved by: [Unovamata](https://github.com/Unovamata "Unovamata"). Original developer: autobuyerneopets.

I have been using this Auto-Buyer tool since its release. From auto-pricing to auto-buying, I have removed every pay-wall imposed by the original developer, NeoBuyer+ is 
a free project, with the mission of making restocking accessible to all Neopets users.

> **Use the tool at your own risk, do not be greedy.** Research legitimate times and adjust settings based on your ping. Lower the Autobuyer's times if you lose out on too many items, but use the tool responsibly.

## Tips

- Read the FAQs that comes along the extension in the Tools > Miscellaneous > NeoBuyer+'s FAQs for more information.
- I have not yet received any warnings or experienced account freezing while using this AutoBuyer extension. However, I would suggest some tips and guidelines to help prevent potential issues with Neopets.
- Firstly, it's essential not to be too greedy while restocking. It's recommended not to go on ABing for more than 8 hours at a stretch as it may draw Neopets' attention towards your account. So, let's use common sense and not overdo it.
- In case you fail to buy an expensive item, don't worry. It's better to keep a low profile and aim for less profitable items. It's not what you stock but how many items you stock. You can choose shops with high profitability or low competition.
- Before activating the ABer, make sure to check all your options carefully. Most of the options are set in milliseconds, so it's best to be cautious while setting them up.
- To search for items that you want to buy from specific shops and create your own custom item sniping list, you can use JellyNeo's item databases and play around with the filters their database offers. In the future, we will offer a tool that allows for the extraction of this data so you can parse correctly in the extension.

## New Features

- Cracked the multiple paywalls the extension had.
- Cleaner interfaces with better navigation.
- [Neon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neon/hpbfhmapaaocfnpmbikclmeokcgpljnm "Neon") extension integration for quicker SW searches.

## End Notes

As always thanks to the [original developer.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neopets-shop-attic-highli/gcoedojijoejlngkneocccmnjkbbbfmd "original developer.") that allowed NeoBuyer to work as a foundation for this project.
