            Start by creating a free EmailJS account at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emailjs.com/">www.emailjs.com</a>. This is a third party service which will allow you to send emails automatically to yourself. Then create an "Email Service" by linking an email account that you own. Once you have done that, there will be a <b>Service ID</b> listed:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/Service_ID.png">
            <br><br>
            Then, create a new email template will the following contents. You can create a link to automatically link to the JellyNeo listing for the item by linking to the URL "https://items.jellyneo.net/search/?name={{item}}". You can style the email however you want to, but the {{status}} {{item}} {{notes}} fields are mandatory.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/Template.png">
            <br><br>
            You will now have a <b>Template ID</b> visible after saving:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/Template_ID.png">
            <br><br>
            Lastly, you can view your <b>User ID</b>:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/User_ID.png">
            <br><br>
            These are the 3 IDs that you will need to add into your options page for NeoBuyer. You can purcahse an item to test that everything is set up correctly, and you should recieve an email if NeoBuyer is running.
