    <h2>New Version 0.7.7.2:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Thank you all once again for all your support! 
            <br><br>Version 0.7 has been one of the most extensive updates for the extension in terms of features. As we look ahead to version 0.8, I am thrilled to introduce some exciting new features in version 0.7.7.2.
        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Show Your Support:</strong>  Consider starring NeoBuyer+ or sending a <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unovamata" target="_blank">Donation</a></b>  as a token of appreciation. This is made free for everyone to use after hundreds of hours of hard work, so thank you for your continuous support.</li><br><br>

        <li><strong>AutoPricer <sup style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">Turbo</sup>:</strong> The original AutoPricer was quite slow, therefore it has been improved in version 0.7.7.2.
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>Faster AutoPricing:</strong> To better mimic human behavior the original AutoPricer had many wait times and cooldowns, making it inconveniently slow. Thankfully, that issue has been fixed with "Turbo" mode! 
                <br><br>This new AutoPricer mode removes all slowdowns for faster AutoPricing. Turbo mode is optional for all users. If you prefer playing it safe, you can stick to the original AutoPricer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>

        <li><strong>Restock List Generator:</strong> While version 0.8 is in the works, a new alternative has been created to replace database usage in the mean time. 
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>Automatic Restock List Generation:</strong> Maintaining an updated database has been challenging due to TNT introducing items constantly in the game. Fortunately, the Restock List Generator helps address the current database issues!
                    <br><br>This tool allows the creation of clean restocking lists with minimal effort. In the future, more formats may be supported if any alternatives arise.

            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Version 0.7 in Restrospective:</strong>
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>Haggling Changes:</strong> Improved to make haggles mimick human behaviour. Now it is quite difficult to pin-point the usage of NeoBuyer+ based on your haggles alone!</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoKQ:</strong> For all your Auto Kitchen Quest needs, very useful for training considering the BD plot is right around the corner!</li>
                <br><li><strong>Faster AutoPricing.</strong></li>
                <br><li><strong>Restock List Generator.</strong></li>
                <br><li><strong>Toolbar Improvements.</strong></li>
                <br><li><strong>Stability and Feature Improvements.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>What is Left for Version 0.7?</strong>
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>AutoBuyer Improvements:</strong> Currently, all haggling, AuyoBuying, and AutoAttic activities run in a single script. These features will all become their own separate script to improve AutoBuying speeds.</li>
                <br><li><strong>History & AutoKQ Analytics:</strong> This feature has been broken since version 0.5, but now it is returning stronger than ever!</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoPricer Shop Owner Frozen Detection:</strong> If the AutoPricer detects the owner of a shop has been frozen, then it will not count its price as being the lowest in the Shop Wizard.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Updating the FAQs.</strong></li>
                <br><li><strong>Possible Discord Server.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>What is to come?</strong>
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>Real-time Database Updates:</strong> NeoBuyer+ will have the possibility of updating its database in real-time, removing the need of manual Database updates.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoSniper:</strong> For AutoBuying and sniping using the Shop Wizard.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoStock / AutoSDB:</strong> Useful for automatically sending items to your Shop Stock or Safety Deposit Box.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoBD:</strong> For all your Battledome needs.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoAuctions:</strong> For AutoBuying in player's auctions.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoDailies:</strong> To automate Neopets Dailies.</li>
                <br><li><strong>AutoBuyer Improvements.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>

        I hope you are as excited as I am for all the updates that will come in the future. Thank you once again for your continuous support!
