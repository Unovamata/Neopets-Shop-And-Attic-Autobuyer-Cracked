    <h2>Update Notice:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bot Solving Captcha Before Price Input Bug:</strong> Several users have reported having problems with the haggling part of the AutoBuyer. The problem in question has been detected and I am working on a fix.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Please, update the version of the NeoBuyer promptly whenever you see a version available.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Features Incoming:</strong> Multiple QoL improvements and fixes are incoming in the next version.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Haggle Input Bug:</strong> I am fixing the problem where the bot sends the captcha solution before typing the price inside the input box in the haggling page.
                <li><strong>Intelligent Haggling:</strong> I am adding a more intelligent haggling algorithm to make the user appear more human, following the guidelines and tips set by more seasoned restockers.</li>
                <li><strong>Auction Commas:</strong> A script designed for a more organized and readable Auction House experience, designed by Zara Kayn.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Closing notes:</strong> I am very sorry about this inconvenient. Please remember NeoBuyer+ is still a work-in-progress. So problems like this will arise every so often. So I'm thankful for your patience and understanding regarding this matter. Thank you for always reporting any found bugs and problems with the extension! Another update will be released in the following days.</li>
