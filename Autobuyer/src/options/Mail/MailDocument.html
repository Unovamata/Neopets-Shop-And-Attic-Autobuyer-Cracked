    <h2>New Version 0.7.5.5 Notice:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I want to express my gratitude to all NeoBuyer+ users for their incredible support and feedback in recent weeks. Despite facing some health issues that temporarily slowed down progress, I am happy to announce the release of Version 0.7.5.5. This update includes several features that were requested by users. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Haggling Improvements:</strong> Users have notified me of several haggling problems NeoBuyer+ has in Neopia's main shops. Sorry for the inconvenience, creating a haggling algorithmn is not an easy task.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Haggling:</strong> This new system mimicks how legit restockers approach haggling. The new haggling algorithm has 96% to 98% success rate. Consistency is key in this new algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>Undetectable Haggling:</strong> This new haggling system is incredibly complex compared to the old random-based method. As a result, there is minimal randomness involved, which makes NeoBuyer+ haggles feel more human-like. 
                    <br>Haggles may take some extra milliseconds to be processed, so I hope you do not mind or notice this change in the AutoBuyer process.</li>
                <li><strong>Warning:</strong> I have noticed some NeoBuyer+ users share their purchases with various Neopets communities. Firstly, thank you for your support – it is much appreciated!
                    <br>While harmless, others might notice your use of NeoBuyer+ and report your account to TNT due to its <i>distinctive</i> haggling style. But do not worry!
                    <br><br>I am aware of this situation, and that is why I have improved the haggling algorithm. <b>Please be cautious about the information you share when NeoBuyer+ is involved.</b>
                    <br>I will do my best to prevent your account from being frozen because of NeoBuyer+. Please be mindful of this warning.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>AutoKQ Improvements:</strong> I hope you have been using the Auto Kitchen Quest Solver, this system will be the basis for a feature coming soon. So, if you spot any errors or issues, please report them promptly.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AutoKQ Log:</strong> Now the AutoKQ system will save your progress while completing Kitchen Quests. The AutoKQ Log will track stat increases, items given, and Neopoints obtained.</li>
                <li><strong>AutoKQ Analytics:</strong> All the data collected from the AutoKQ Log will pave the way for a new Analytics tab for Kitchen Quests in the future. This is mainly done to fix the Analytics tab the History page had in earlier releases of NeoBuyer+. </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Toolbar Reorganization:</strong> Some options have been organized in the toolbar based on their utility, along with the new FAQs page being made available in the toolbar for future reference.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Possible Discord Server:</strong> I am considering the possibility of creating a Discord server for all NeoBuyer+ users in the future.<br> It will be easier for me to get feedback and feature requests in real-time. Plus, you can connect with other NeoBuyer+ users to share configuration presets, tips, and tricks. This may not come until I have completed all my tasks for version 0.7, so thank you for your patience.</li><br><br>
        <li><strong>Show Your Support:</strong>  Consider starring NeoBuyer+ or sending a <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unovamata" target="_blank">Donation</a></b>  as a token of appreciation. This is made free for everyone to use after hundreds of hours of hard work, so thank you for your continuous support.</li>
