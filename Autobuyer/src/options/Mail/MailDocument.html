<div id="title">Welcome to version 0.6v!</div>

<div id="contents">
    This new version of the NeoBuyer+ includes various changes and optimizations to the overall features of the extension, so I hope you enjoy them.
    <br>
    <br>
    For starters, the entire toolbar has been reorganized into sections, as that will improve navigation and general use of the extension, as there are other features in the future.<br>
    <br>
    Now the the "Tools" menu contains a new "Miscellaneous" option. In the "Miscellaneous" menu, you can download and load your option presets to be shared across NeoBuyer+ users, keep in mind that you may require to deactivate some options in order to not share sensible information about your account.
    <br>
    So please, read the tooltips that are in that section to not share any settings that may compromise your account.
    <br>
    Also in that section, you can find useful links, included a FAQs and overall credits to scripts provided in the extension.
    <br><br>
    Secondly, the new "NeoBuyer+ Mail", this section of the extension may not be of much use most of the time, but this will allow me to communicate directly with users of the extension. From alerts, changes in policies, or code on Neopets to better protect your account, among other topics. I will cover all of it here, so thank you for your patience.
    <br>
    This feature alone really slowed down the release of version 0.6v, but I could not skip it at this point and time, as Neopets is often updating some parts of the site and who knows if they will ever address the botting part of the site, so this is more a precaution measure than anything.
    <br>
    Still, <b>if you see a small red dot at the top of your toolbar in the mail option of the menu, please read the mail as soon as possible.</b> I will not bloat your inbox with unncessary messages or information, I will go straight to the point or keep users updated on new version releases along with precautions and changes done to the main features of the project, so keep that in mind.
    <br><br>
    Also, the main reason this section was created. I am here to inform you that the captcha detection algorithm of the extension has been greatly optimized. Now it's faster by 20%, which does not sounds like a lot, but trust me this is huge, as every millisecond counts when it comes to restocking and auto buyers.
    <br>
    The extension also counts with a better captcha handler, resolving captchas a little slower than the last algorithm, but in a more consistent manner. I have had somewhere around 90 to 92% success with this new approach, compared to the other old one that barely bought any unbuyable items because it could not detect captchas as consistently.
    <br><br>
    The problem is, the captcha solver is too fast now, which is a good thing! But it is so fast it now generates times that are not even humanly possible, so please. <b>Adjust your captcha times accordingly and read the FAQs for more information.</b> Use the restocking timer script included in past versions of the extension to balance out speed vs anonimity.
    <br><br>
    Generally, the extension has gotten a massive overhaul in various places, so I am glad you have been enjoying the project thus far. <b>Remember to star the project if possible, as it would help me a lot in the future. This has been a work of hundreds of hours and it would be a nice token of appreciation to star the project considering it is free ;)</b>
    <br><br>
    See you next time and happy auto buying!
