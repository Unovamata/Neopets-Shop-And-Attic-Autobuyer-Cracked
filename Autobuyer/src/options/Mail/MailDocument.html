    <h2>Update Notice:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Please download the newest version:</strong> The bugs reported have been fixed along with a better version of the haggling algorithm, making more intelligent offers while also being as undetectable as possible, mimicking the behaviour of more seasoned restockers.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Please, update to version 0.61.5 if possible, as every 0.6 release possesses either unoptimized haggling methods or is outdated. This will make the bot's haggling style almost undetectable. I am sorry if this has caused any inconvenience.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Show Your Support:</strong> Consider starring our project as a token of appreciation. This is made free for everyone to use after hundreds of hours, it will help me in the future if you starred this project :).</li>
