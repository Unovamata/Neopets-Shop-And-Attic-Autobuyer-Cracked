    <h2>Version 0.7v Release</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Version 0.7v has finally arrived! Stability and a new automation Feature are the keywords of this version, so thank you for sticking around!<br>
            <strong>Please download version 0.7v:</strong> New bugs may appear, yet the AutoBuyer has been the most stable it has ever been. Remember to report bugs if you experience any.
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unovamata" target="_blank">Donations</a></strong>: Version 0.7v added a new button for those interested in supporting NeoBuyer+ in a monetary way. This is the only multi-functional, most capable AutoBuyer out there.<br>
                    NeoBuyer+ will always be free, but some monetary retribution would be wonderful. Thank you once again for all your support.
                <li><strong>Some GUI Changes:</strong> Version 0.7v places Shop Wizard related features on their own specific category.</li>
                <li><strong><sup></sup>Auto Kitchen Quest Solver <sup>beta</sup>:</strong> Version 0.7v comes with the AutoKQ Solver, this feature primarilly depends on your AutoPricer settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Official AutoPricer Release:</strong> Thank you all for your thorough testing, the AutoPricer is now on its most stable version and it is no longer a beta. Thank you for your contributions!</li>
                <li><strong>Version 0.8v AutoSniper:</strong> In Version 0.8v may add an AutoSniper for those interested in sniping other users' shops. Version 0.8 will also overhaul the entire database system, so keep an eye out on that.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Show Your Support:</strong> Consider starring NeoBuyer+ or sending a <b><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unovamata" target="_blank">Donation</a></b> as a token of appreciation.
