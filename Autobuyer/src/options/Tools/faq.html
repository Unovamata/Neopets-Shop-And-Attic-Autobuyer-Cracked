            <div class="faq-question">2. Is this extension genuinely free? Can I trust it not to compromise my security or engage in malicious activities? It almost seems too good to be true.</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                We completely understand your concerns and skepticism regarding this extension. In the world of Neopets botting, most shop auto-buyers come at a cost. However, we are changing the game by providing an alternative that has been adapted, improved, and most importantly free. <b>This extension does the contrary, as it gives you enough options to make the installation and its usage as silent and anonymous as possible.</b>
                <br><br>
                Our mission from the start has been to make restocking accessible to all users. This project also serves as a valuable opportunity for me to delve into web development and create Chrome extensions, making it a win-win situation.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Please consider starring the project on its official GitHub page if you find it valuable.</b> Your support would greatly benefit the project's continued development. NeoBuyer+ has been a product of hundreds of hours of work, and <b>your star would be a small token of appreciation while you enjoy the benefits of NeoBuyer+ for free!</b>

            <div class="faq-question">3. Is the extension compatible with languages other than English?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                <b>This extension exclusively functions in English.</b> If you find that it consistently purchases the first item from each store or fails to buy anything at all, the issue is often due to language disparities. As items have varying names in different languages, the extension may not identify them. <b>To ensure optimal performance, set your Neopets language preference to English.</b>
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">4. How can I prevent the extension from switching between stores during refresh?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                If you'd like to keep multiple main shops open without any automatic switching, set your <b>"Store numbers to cycle through when stocked" setting to [ ]</b>. This configuration informs NeoBuyer+ not to switch stores but only to refresh the shop(s) you have open. NeoBuyer+ will maintain your preferred stores open without switching.
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">5. My Neopets pages are frequently freezing, loading slowly, crashing, and I'm encountering Chrome's certification error messages. What is happening?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                <b>This problem is associated with Neopets' servers and not with NeoBuyer+.</b> The increased number of online users can overload the servers, leading to errors for all users. It's important to note that this issue is affecting the entire site and is not specific to NeoBuyer+. <b>Fortunately, NeoBuyer+ can automatically refresh pages that encounter errors</b>, ensuring uninterrupted auto-buying.
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">6. What causes NeoBuyer to stall on the haggling page, resulting in an item being sold out?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                <b>This phenomenon is referred to as "pet lag" and is not specific to NeoBuyer+; it affects all players.</b> Neopets experiences lag after a pet click. To delve deeper into this issue, you can explore relevant discussions on various forums. <br>
                It is worth noting that this is not a problem that can be resolved, and in fact, <b>addressing it would make your auto-buyer usage obvious to TNT.</b>
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">7. Does the extension support Black Market Boon site event items from the Battleground of the Obelisk?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                <b>No, the extension does not currently support these items.</b> While support for these items may be added in a future update, for now, it's safest to assume that items exclusive to the boon are not yet supported. <b>If you decide to purchase them, the autobuyer will still handle the process as usual</b>, but it cannot initially detect these items for auto-clicking at the moment.
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">8. The extension continues to purchase unprofitable items! Can you update the item database with the most up-to-date prices?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Sorry, please note that our item database relies on Jellyneo's pricing data. Due to frequent price fluctuations, <b>we cannot update our database regularly to avoid straining Jellyneo's servers. To address this issue, you have the following options:</b><br><br>

                <b>1.</b> Blacklist items you don't wish to purchase.<br>
                <b>2.</b> Maintain a list for consistent purchasing.<br>
                <b>3.</b> Adjust the minimum profit value in the database settings to prevent unprofitable purchases with NeoBuyer+.
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">9. Is it necessary to keep the AutoBuyer actively running in the foreground, or is it possible to have the tab running in the background?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                You can maintain the tab in the background; however, it's essential to be aware that <b>Chrome may limit the performance of background tab execution.</b> For optimal performance, especially when restocking in primary shops, it's advisable to keep the tab in focus on your computer.
                <br>
                A practical approach is to have one tab open for main shops and another for the attic. You can then split your screen between them, ensuring that neither is affected by Chrome's performance throttling.
                <center><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.chromium.org/2020/11/tab-throttling-and-more-performance.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1697751237558145&usg=AOvVaw3crXvNvMf7kGCWBM8i-0pl"><b>For more information on tab throttling, you can refer to this resource.</b><a></a></center><br>
            </p>
            <div class="faq-question">10. What are the most optimal settings?</div>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                <b>We'd prefer not to provide a specific answer to that question.</b> TNT keeps logs that track restocking activities, so it can raise suspicion if they observe a large number of new users displaying the speed and proficiency of experienced restockers.
                <br>
                A safe approach is to begin with a set of settings and gradually adjust them over time. <b>It is advisable to avoid clicking items within a 50-millisecond timeframe and to refrain from rapid haggling within 100 milliseconds.</b> Actions that closely resemble human behavior are less likely to result in account suspensions.
                <br><br>
                For human-like actions on the captcha page, you can configure NeoBuyer+ to anywhere between 1000 or 800 milliseconds. Delays below 700 are risky, sometimes this will guarantee obtaining unbuyable items, but it will likely lead to account freezes later down the line. <b>Be careful and do not be greedy, remember about the logs TNT has at their disposal at all times.</b>
